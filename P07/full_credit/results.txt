HOMEWORK P07 RESULTS

Fall 2024


FULL CREDIT
===========

NOTE: These are measurements which may vary plus your opinions which may vary a LOT. We won't grade for "correctness", just completeness.

QUESTION 1: What Boggle command line arguments ([#boards] and if not default [boardSize])did you use to achieve a 30 to 45 second runtime? Note: We're only interested in the "real" seconds for this question.






QUESTION 2: Provide the full output (including the time command) for your program, with 1 to 16 threads. **Ensure that the result is the same for all 16 runs.** With bash, you can run all of these with a single command if you like, replacing "90" with whatever Boggle command line arguments you identified in QUESTION 1: 

for i in {1..16} ; do echo ; echo $i Threads; time java Boggle 90 - $i ; done




QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?



QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?

Yes, from 0.285 seconds to 1.667 seconds for this data set







BONUS
=====

QUESTION 5: Time your version of Boggle as you did for the full credit version. Is this additional layer of threading faster, slower, or roughly equivalent in performance? Why?
